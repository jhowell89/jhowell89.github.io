      <p>My name is Jarez Howell, I'm married to a beautiful woman with four amazing children. I grew up in a house with eleven family members in my household including my great grandmother and grandfather. when I was growing up, I would watch every L.A Laker game with my uncles, before I went outside to shoot around for two hours even at night. I loved basketball ever since.</p>
      <p>I was lucky enough to have an uncle that was in the computer field who's very smart and also gave me motivation to pursue a career in the software field, currently I attend a Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Chapel Hill which is a dream come true.</p>
